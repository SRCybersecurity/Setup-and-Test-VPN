### 4. Verify IP address change

- Visit: [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com), [ip2location.com](https://www.ip2location.com)
- **Before VPN:** Displayed my actual ISP and city.
- **After VPN:** IP address changed to the VPN server’s IP (e.g., showed Netherlands or Switzerland).
- Confirmed the IP address was successfully changed.

---

### 5. Browse a website to confirm encrypted traffic

- Browsed to: [https://duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com)
- Confirmed websites loaded normally.
- ProtonVPN uses **AES-256 encryption**, ensuring traffic is encrypted end-to-end.

---

### 6. Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP

- Disconnected from the VPN.
- Revisited whatismyipaddress.com – confirmed original IP was restored.
- Browsing speed slightly improved after disconnection (free VPNs tend to throttle speeds).
- Speed while connected to VPN: Slightly slower (streaming and downloads affected).

### 7. Research: VPN encryption and privacy features

**Encryption:**

- ProtonVPN uses **AES-256 encryption** and **OpenVPN / WireGuard protocols**.
- These ensure confidentiality and integrity of your data.

**Privacy Features:**

- **No-logs policy:** ProtonVPN doesn’t store user activity logs.
- **Kill switch:** Cuts off internet if VPN disconnects, preventing accidental IP leaks.
- **DNS leak protection:** Ensures DNS queries go through the encrypted VPN tunnel.

### 8. Summary: VPN Benefits & Limitations

**Benefits:**

**Limitations:**
